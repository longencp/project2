     <li>The endpoints and parameters are appropriately named</li>
     <li>The web serice sends/recieves JSON files</li>
     <li>There is a post, get, patch, and delete endpoint in this webservice</li>
     <li>The database is directly accessible from the droplet and not outside, because of my use of ufw</li>
